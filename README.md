# physical-chemistry
A series of Jupyter notebooks developed to help students to solve physical-chemistry problems using python language. The notebooks solve problems proposed by the course bibliography. Those notebooks were used in the second term of the Physical-Chemistry class, of 2020, at UERJ, Faculty of Technology. Those were used in conjunction with Google Colab during the course asynchronous meets.
